2018-05-13 jinamp 1.0.7

I'm abandoning Sourceforge and moving all my code from there to Github. This
involves a few cosmetic changes such as migration from svn to git, updates to
the README and so on, but no changes to the code.

2011-10-22 jinamp 1.0.6

Six years since the last release! This just makes it compile again on a modern
system - if you got 1.0.5 working there is no need to update.

2005-09-28 jinamp 1.0.5

This version adds some minor improvements that I've been meaning to make
for years and never gotten around to. In particular
* --no-shuffle returns, and now actually does something
* jinamp-ctl can insert songs to be played once, then return to the
  regular playlist
Debian support has ceased as I've switched to Gentoo, although the
control files are still in place. If there are any Debian developers
out there who use jinamp, I'd welcome updates to the debian/
subdirectory.

2004-06-15 jinamp 1.0

Since I've been completely happy with jinamp for the last 18 months,
and have received no bug reports, I'm bumping the version to 1.0. The
only real change in this release is the correction of my email address.

2002-12-02 jinamp 0.3.9

Wow, almost a year since the last release! This release finally
includes something I've been wanting to add for a long time but haven't
found time for: jinamp-ctl. It replaces all the crude control using
signals with a program that sends commands to jinamp using IPC. So
far the actual functionality is pretty similar, with the big exception
being the ability to replace the playlist at runtime.

The version number of 0.3.9 indicates that this is more or less 0.4, but
still needs some testing and improvements.

2001-12-09 jinamp 0.3

This is a total rewrite of the list management code, to use AVL trees.
On my system this takes 30% off the startup time, and the more files
you have the bigger the speedup you should see. Version 0.2 was
particularly slow when filenames came sorted, which in practice is often
the case (e.g. the bash sorts wildcard expansions).

The command line parameter parsing has also been rewritten, to support
intersection and precedence. It is currently slower than jinamp 0.2.2.2
when processing the same command line (although this is probably more
than compensated for by the AVL trees) but this should be improved in
later versions.

2001-11-16 jinamp 0.2.2.1

I've now made the detection of playlists and exclude sets configurable
via a regex. Also fixed one or two minor bugs (see ChangeLog).

2001-11-10 jinamp 0.2.2

Lots more changes! The big news is that you can now create a config
file ~/.jinamp that can set the player (can be overridden on the
command line). The rest is mainly internal shuffling to make the config
file code work.

2001-11-08 jinamp 0.2.1

There have been lots of changes - don't let the small version increment
fool you. For the moment I'm keeping the version numbers small by
bumping the 3rd component for smallish changes and the second one when
I reach some sort of milestone.

Probably the biggest change is that you can now override the player
with --player=<player>. That means that pre-compiled binaries are
now actually useful, using a script or alias that passes this parameter
every time.

You can also configure with --enable-suid, in which case `make install'
will install jinamp SUID so that it can get a higher priority.

The other big change is that there is now a man page!

2001-11-01 jinamp 0.2

jinamp 0.2 is unleased on an unsuspecting public.
