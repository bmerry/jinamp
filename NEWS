2001-12-09 jinamp 0.3

This is a total rewrite of the list management code, to use AVL trees.
On my system this takes 30% off the startup time, and the more files
you have the bigger the speedup you should see. Version 0.2 was
particularly slow when filenames came sorted, which in practice is often
the case (e.g. the bash sorts wildcard expansions).

The command line parameter parsing has also been rewritten, to support
intersection and precedence. It is currently slower than jinamp 0.2.2.2
when processing the same command line (although this is probably more
than compensated for by the AVL trees) but this should be improved in
later versions.

I've now made the detection of playlists and exclude sets configurable
via a regex. Also fixed one or two minor bugs (see ChangeLog).

Lots more changes! The big news is that you can now create a config
file ~/.jinamp that can set the player (can be overridden on the
command line). The rest is mainly internal shuffling to make the config
file code work.

There have been lots of changes - don't let the small version increment
fool you. For the moment I'm keeping the version numbers small by
bumping the 3rd component for smallish changes and the second one when
I reach some sort of milestone.

Probably the biggest change is that you can now override the player
with --player=<player>. That means that pre-compiled binaries are
now actually useful, using a script or alias that passes this parameter
every time.

You can also configure with --enable-suid, in which case `make install'
will install jinamp SUID so that it can get a higher priority.

The other big change is that there is now a man page!

jinamp 0.2 is unleased on an unsuspecting public.
